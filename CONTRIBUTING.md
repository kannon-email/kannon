```sh
make lint
```

## Code Style & Best Practices

- Follow idiomatic Go (gofmt, goimports).
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and types.
- Write unit and integration tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Document exported functions and types.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid breaking backward compatibility unless necessary (discuss in an issue first).

## Submitting Issues & Feature Requests

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kannon-email/kannon/issues) for bugs, enhancements, and questions.
- For feature requests, describe the use case and proposed solution.
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.

## Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` or the relevant feature branch.
2. Make your changes, following the code style guidelines.
3. Add or update tests as needed.
4. Run all tests and linters locally.
5. Push your branch and open a PR against the main repository.
6. Fill out the PR template, describing your changes and motivation.
7. Participate in the code review processâ€”respond to feedback and make necessary changes.
8. PRs are merged after passing CI and review.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
